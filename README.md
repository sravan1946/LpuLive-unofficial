## About

LPU Live is an unofficial Flutter application for the LPU Live chat platform. This project is open-sourced to demonstrate that the codebase is safe, transparent, and trustworthy for users.

## Downloads & Releases

Pre-built releases are available from the **[lpulive-builds](https://github.com/sravan1946/lpulive-builds)** repository. Please visit that repository to download the latest builds for your platform.

> **Note**: The builds are hosted in a separate repository because the initial plan was to keep the codebase private. However, we've now decided to make the source code public to ensure transparency and build trust with the community.
